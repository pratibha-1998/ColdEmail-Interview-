This trick got me multiple job interviews when the market was bad!

A year ago, during my job switch preparations, I was lost. The job market was bad and opportunities were less. Getting an interview call was super tough, but I still managed to get multiple interview calls! How?

âœ… Cold emailing.

Though getting a response was tough, it worked for me! In fact, it was the magic of cold emailing got me into Google!
